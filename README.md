# Random walk on PySDL 
Inspirated by **Daniel Hirsch's** video "Coding a Random Walk in C" (https://youtu.be/ErA4U9WqNCE?si=Eh6SumtlEvTJXRTH). This is my realization of it in Python using SDL3.

Made purely for enjoyment.
# Features
  - Custom number of random walkers (agents) 
  - Each of the agents has it's unique random color
  - Real-time vizualization using SDL3
  - hsl / rgb random colors to make them look more vibrant
# Installation
  1. Clone the repository:
     ```
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-walk-python.git
      cd random-walk-python
     ```
  2. Install dependencies:
     ```
     pip install pysdl3
     pip install pysdl3-dll <- Windows
     ```
# Usage
  Run with: 
  ```
  python random-walk.py 
  ```

You of course can modify pretty much everything in `random-walk.py` such as window size, amount of agents (which is N), <br>
their colors and direction e.t.c.
## Optional additions could include:
  - Background color
  - Edge behaviour
  - Pause / resume via keyboard controls
  
Would veery much appreciate any contributions to this repository. This code would be also avaliable on Github Gist.

Thank you for reading.
